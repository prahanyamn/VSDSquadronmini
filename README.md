# VSDSquadron mini internship

The VSDSquadron Mini is a compact development board designed around the RISC-V architecture. It is particularly geared towards hobbyists, students, and developers who are interested in exploring and developing on the RISC-V platform.

## FEATURES:
#### RISC-V Processor:
The board is equipped with a RISC-V processor core, likely a 32-bit (RV32I) or 64-bit (RV64I) variant, depending on the specific model.

#### Compact Design:
Its small form factor makes it highly portable and easy to integrate into various projects.

#### Memory:
Includes onboard RAM and possibly flash memory for storage of firmware and applications.

#### Connectivity:
Features a range of I/O options, which typically include:
+ GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins
+ UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter)
+ SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
+ I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

#### Programming and Debugging:
Supports standard RISC-V development tools and toolchains such as GCC, LLVM, and various RISC-V IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).
Likely includes a JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface for debugging purposes.
